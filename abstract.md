# Hacking the micro:bit - Python to IoT

The BBC micro:bit is small ARM-based computer that 11 and 12 year olds are using in schools to learn about programming, 
creativity and physical computing. But it's not just for kids! It's a fully featured, tiny IoT-style machine with a 
load of on-board features that make it brilliant for those wanting to explore embedded devices or where programming 
interfaces with electronics tinkering. 

In this session you'll learn what the micro:bit has to offer, how to get up and running with some simple examples, how 
to build some more sophisticated projects using clusters of interacting devices and the range of languages you can 
explore on this platform. 

You will learn how to use:

* Bluetooth LE,
* Accelerometer
* Compass
* Radio
* Programmable digital and analog IO
* LED matrix screen
* Voice synthesizer
* Music capabilities

If Javascript, Python or Microsoft's Touch Develop language sound too easy, we'll explore how to rebuild the 
microbit to run C++ or Rust code and convert it into a true IoT device.

*It's a platform that is really easy to get started and really difficult to give up. Come and discover what it's all 
about and wave goodbye to your remaining free time!*
